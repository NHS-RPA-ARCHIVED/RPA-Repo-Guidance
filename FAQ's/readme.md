# Frequently asked Questions

Q: Does Open Source mean free?
A: Open source automations are free from up-front licence fees or capital outlays. Depending on the underlying software, you may need to purchase subscriptions as well as specialist help to implement and support users of the solution.


Q: How is an Open Source software licence?
A: Open Source software is generally licensed through an open-source agreement (such as AGPL, MIT, BSD, Apache, etc.) that allows organisations to develop and tailor the software to suit local needs..


Q: Is Open Source safe?
A: The increasing adoption of open source solutions has resulted in a growing network of user and developer communities who continually review, troubleshoot and improve, in the case of this Programme, automations. The original developer organisation usually safeguards any developments, taking on a custodian role of the software, ensuring that it continues to satisfy NHS Information Governance and clinical safety requirements.


Q: What support can I expect?
A: Support is available either from the communities involved in the development and usage of the automations or from the original developer organisation, although a charge may be applied for the provision of the latter.  Because the use of the automations under this Programme will usually also require subscription to an OEMâ€™s underlying software platform, the user may also be entitled to receive support from the OEM depending upon their agreement.


 Software that incorporates components licensed under the OGL V3 can be licensed for a fee.
