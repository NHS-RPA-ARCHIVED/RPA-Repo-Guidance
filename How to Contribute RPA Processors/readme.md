## 1. Create A Github account

To create a Github account please follow the instructions on the Github joining page https://github.com/join

## 2. Register your account with the NHS England Productivity team

Once you have created your Git hub account email digital.productivity@nhsx.nhs.uk and request you want contributors permissions to the NHS RPA directorate with the following details

1. Firstname
2. Surname
3. Organisation
4. GitHub Username

Once we have received and vetted the detail the team will then be in contact to provide an update on contributor access

## 3. Setup Git on your Computer

Git is a type of version control software that tracks changes in your code. For example, when you edit a file, git can help you determine exactly what changed, who changed it, and why.

Itâ€™s a useful tool for collaborating with other people and lets you undo mistakes or identify bugs.

Git is not the same as GitHub. Git stores versions of your work, and lets you collaborate more easily with others. GitHub puts it all online with a friendly web interface.

Launching the NHS England RPA GitHub page is part of a wider strategy to make our work more open and collaborative, with the twin aims of tackling bigger issues in Robotic Process Automation and sharing learning. We hope this will help accelerate innovation in RPA and the wider use of RPA technologies across the health and care ecosystem.

Details on how to install and setup git can be found at https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git
